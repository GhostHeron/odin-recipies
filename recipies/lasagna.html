<p>Garfield : [Garfield's round figure prevents him to enter the playhouse, shows signs of struggle]  Does this castle make my butt look a little too big?

    Winston : [Standing behind Garfield]  Fits you like a glove.
    
    Winston : [Garfield strains through  <br>the entrance and due to excessive pressure, he emits a fart into Winston's face]  Ooh! Blimey.
    
    Garfield : Pardon.
    <br>
    Winston : Well struck, sire. Good tone, smooth finish.
    
    Garfield : Well, you took that in the best spirit, didn't you?
    
    Winston : [End scene, in pool]  Great party, sire!
    <br>
    Garfield : Yep. When the going gets tough, the great ones party.
    
    [after being served a plate of Carlyle log]  <br>
    
    Garfield : Ugh. Does a <br> <br> Great Dane li <br>ve here?
    <br>
    Winston : It's your Carlyle l <br>og, my lord. A savory of liver and spleen served in a sleeve of sheep's intestines.
    <br>
    Garfield : And... you're sup <br>posed to eat it? What is this, Fear Factor? Intestines, spleen?
    
    [pushes the plate away <br>] 
    
    Garfield : I'm the king, right?
    
    Winston : Prince, actually. <br>
    
    Garfield : Same differe <br>nce, I rule. Yes?
    
    Winston : Yes, Your Highness.
    <br>
    Garfield : Great. Well, feed this to the hu <br>mans, and just bring me a piping hot dish of lasagna. Okay?
    <br> <br>
    Winston : I'll see to it at once, sire.
    
    Garfield : Okay.
    
    [jumps onto the table] 
    
    Garfield : Hold it right here, all you animals. What goes on here, Winston?
    <br>sagna, sire. Unless you prefer another dish.
    <br> <br>
    Garfield : Did you say dish? Lasagna's not a dish, windbag. It's a way of life. A state of being one's perfect achievement. What did the Indians serve to the Pilgrims? Lasagna. What did Marie Antoinette scream to the rebel? "Let them eat lasagna." What did Neil Armstrong say when he landed on the moon? "That's one small slice of lasagna." It's not a dish. It's the stuff of dreams. It's the food of the gods. It's what's for lunch.
    
    Winston : Well, it seems we <br>'ve already mucked it up.
    <br> <br>
    Garfield : You just need a little  <br>guidance, that's all.
    
    Preston : It's the real  <br>
    Prince : Yes, my friends, I have returned to you at this, our darkest hour. So tell me Winston, what exactly is Lord Dargis up to?
    
    Winston : He intends to level our homes and kill us all.
    
    Prince : O... kay. Well, in that c <br>ase, I decree that we pack our bags and get our scraggy bottoms out of here. Perhaps to the castle next door.
    <br>
    Garfield : [turns to leave]  Oh boy.
    <br>
    Nigel : Well, that was inspirational.
    
    Bolero : Brilliant <br>.
    
    McBunny : I am so f <br>ired up.
    
    Garfield : [walking back]  <br> You know, I believe we can do better.
    <br>
    Preston : I thought you w <br>
    Garfield : Hey. Button the beak, <br> Froot Loops, or I'll stick that thing on backwards. Look, Lord Doofus is just another bully. And what do we do to bullies?
    <br>
    Meenie : Well, generally, we <br> run from them.
    
    Garfield : [confident]  No, <br> we don't leave. We stand and we kick royal butt. Trust me, if you beastsssss can bake a two-cheese lasagna, you can beat Dargis.
    
    Preston : Well, do you have a plan, Garfield?
    
    Garfield : Tell you what <br>. For the duration of this battle I would prefer to be called "G-Cat". And *we*...
    
    [indicating Prince] 
    
    Garfield : ... have *t <br>wo* plans.
    
    Prince : [realizing]  <br> Oh teamwork.
    
    Nigel : Got it. Could have  <br>just come down and told me that, couldn't he? Alright, listen up. Barnyard newsflash. I've got some good news and some bad news. Which would you like to hear first?
    
    Christophe , Bolero , Eenie  <br>, McBunny : The bad news.
    
    Nigel : Lord Dargis jus <br>t threw Prince in the river.
    
    [animals panic] 
    
    Winston : Okay,  <br>give me the good news.
    
    Nigel <br> : He was in a lovely picnic basket.
    <br>
    Eenie : If he throws us in th <br>e river, we'll never survive!
    
    Christophe : You're ducks, y <br>ou could swim.
    
    Eenie : Oh. <br>
    
    Preston : [enters the barn <br>yard with a scroll]  Winston, I'm next in line for the throne.
    
    Bolero : Uh-oh. This could  <br>get ugly.
    
    Preston : [roll <br>s out the scroll]  I have here a new list of rules for governance.
    
    Winston : Preston, I har <br>dly think that's necessary.
    <br>
    Preston : Rule number one.  <br>The barnyard animals congregate entirely too close to the castle. We house pets need our space.
    
    McBunny : Oh, you've got enough spa <br>ce, laddie, right between your ears!
    
    [animals laugh]  <br>
    
    Preston : You take that back! I  <br>command you! As your new king...
    <br>
    Winston : Look. There's still  <br>a chanc <br>e Prince may find his way back here. In the meantime, Claudius, you go into the castle and find out what Dargis is up to.
    
    I, Claudius : I'm on it <br>. I'm your  <br>mouse on the inside.
    
    Winston : I' <br>ll see what I can learn from my end.
    
    Winston :  <br>Oyez, oyez. Pri <br>nce XII has returned.
    
    [ducks trumpet] 
    <br> <br>
    Garfield : Thank you wind <br>bag, for that flobbering introduction. Hello, everybody!
    
    [animals look in astoni <br>shment]  <br>
    <br>
    Garfield : Hey, list <br>en up...
    
    [flicks Winsto <br>n's nose] 
    
    Garfield : is this an audi <br>ence or a landscape? Okay, great to  <br>be back here at the palace. I look out, I see a sea of... of dumb barnyard animals. I'm here in your country to break up a romance between the guy who owns the house I live in and a girl who's way out of his league. I know that whatever it is that you have, there's some sort of affliction that produces this glazed look behind your eyes. I hope you defeat it. Wish I could take everybody home with me. Thank you.
    
    [walks away] 
    
    Garfield : I killed.
    
    Winston : Very fun <br>ny, sire. Well done.
    <br>
    Nigel : I didn't realize it was  <br>amateur hour.
    
    Eenie : What's up with Prince?
    
    Christophe : Oh <br>, he's on the catnip again.
    
    I, Claudius : Hold on, chaps! H <br>ave I got news for you!
    
    McBunny : Wha <br>t's the word, Claudius?
    
    I, Claudius : Dargis is goi <br>ng to bulldoze the barnyard and feed us to the tourists!
    
    Nigel : Let him try. He'll have to deal with these fists of fury first, wouldn't he?
    
    [animals complain]  <br>
    
    Winston : Calm yourselves, e <br>veryone. We're alright as long as Prince is alive.
    
    McBunny : Well, obvi <br>ously, that feline is not Prince, you idiots!
    
    Preston : He's not even a c <br>at formerly <br> known as Prince.
    
    [animals argue] 
    
    Winston : Wait, he doesn't  <br> to be Prince. He just has to look like him. If he fooled me, he'll fool them.
    
    McBunny : But what's to stop Dargis fro <br>m getting rid of this cat too?
    <br>
    Winston : McBunny's right. We must protect this cat at all costs. Our fates rely on it.
    <br>
    Garfield : Holy cow. I could hear my footsteps. Mom... Dad... I'm home.
    
    Winston : Your highness!
    <br>
    Garfield : You're talking to me, froggy?
    
    Winston : It's me, your trusty servant, Winston.
    
    Garfield : Hey...
    
    [shows off some fighting moves] 
    
    Garfield : Warning, I don't fight fair. I scratch, and I bite.
    <br>
    Winston : It's alright, sire. All is well now, your home.
    
    Garfield : Home? A retirement hom <br>e, a happy home? So what is this... is this an insane asylum? Am I being kidnapped?
    
    Winston : Ha, ha, ha. Very funny, s <br>e. Your loyal subjects await you. They need to be comforted by your word.
    <br> <br>
    Garfield : Hey... trust me, windbag. There's no way I'm gonna give a speech to a bunch of deranged...
    <br>
    Winston : And then of course, following your words, a royal feast.
    <br> <br>
    Garfield : [interested]  I th <br>ink I'm just gonna do a tight two minutes, see if that will calm 'em down, okay?
    
    Garfield : Come, m <br>y pumpkin windbag. We're ready to roll.
    
    Winston : Roll? Where to?
    
    Garfield : You know, to the h <br> <br>otel, to Jon.
    
    Winston : Your master? The one who's leaving you for his new wife?
    
    Garfield : He's not leaving me. It's more of a... temporary insanity thing.
    <br>
    Winston : Garfield, your master started a new life. It's time for you to begin yours. Come on, I wanna show you something.
    
    Garfield : Look at this room, for example. How are you gonna liven this place up?
    
    Winston : But sire, this castle is centuries old.
    
    Garfield : It's a museum. It's boring. And you know what's missing when your crib is a museum? It's called fun!
    
    Winston : Fun?
    
    Garfield : It's not that hard, you just need a running start at something. Just... whoa...
    
    Winston : This is gonna end u <br>p so badly.
    
    [Garfield slides across the floor and bumps into a table which sends a flower vase falling to the floor] 
    
    Garfield : It was already cracked.
    
    Winston : Ha-ha. Nothing escapes you, sire.
    
    Garfield : Yeah, I like the way this feels. You slide, baby. Whoa...
    
    [knocks over a china vase a <br>nd breaks it] 
    
    Garfield : D'uh oh.
    
    Winston : Don't worry about that. That one was cracked as well.
    
    Garfield : [leans against a statue]  Oh, I can relax. Oops.
    
    [the st <br>atue tips over, knocking down all th <br>e other statues in succession] 
    
    Dargis : [enters the museum]  What the... Oof!
    
    [last statue falls on Dargis] 
    
    Dargis : Smithee! Get this thing off me!
    
    Garfield : Oh, let's go try another room.
    
    Winston : Good idea, sire.
    
    Garfield : Careful <br>. That's high-quality American cardboard you're tossing around in there. Beautiful, fellas. Hang the plasma over the slip-and-slide.
    
    Winston : Sire, a word?
    
    Garfield : Jowls, my lad. Guess what your enlightened, all- <br>powerful ruler has brought to the castle.
    
    Preston : Oh, I can't wait to hear this.
    
    Winston : Don't tell me, a Renaissance painting.
    
    Garfield : Foosball, you know, foosball.
    
    Winston : Fo-fo-fo-foosball?
    
    Preston : What do you think this is, a pub?
    
    Garfield : Just because we  <br>don't have opposable thumbs, doesn't mean we don't play bargains.
    
    Winston : Yes sire, but I feel your life is in danger.
    
    Garfield : Listen, Winnebago, if I may call you  <br>that. When history speaks of me, and she will, I wanna be remembered as the Party Prince.
    
    Winston : As you wish.
    
    Nigel : You chaps know me, I'm no snob, right? But this cat is too much.
    
    Preston : That is an embarrassment to our whole way of life.
    <br>
    Nigel : He's a disgrace to the furry race. "My pillow isn't soft enough, my TV remote won't work..."
    v <br>
    Winston : Don't get your knickers in a twist. I know he's a pain in the neck but we just gotta keep him safe till Monday.
    
    [ducks trumpet] 
    
    Garfield : Yeah, my loyal and fragrant subject <br>s. Please, thank you. Briefly, I hate Mondays. I hate 'em. Therefore I decree, from this day forward, there will be no more Mondays.
    
    Eenie , Meenie : What?
    
    Garfield : Got it? Today is Tuesday, then. Happy Tuesday, everybody.
    
    Christophe : Yeah, I think he's l <br>ost it.
    
    Winston : Like I said, we just gotta keep him safe till Tuesday. <br>
    
    Garfield : You know what, I've got two words for that guy: you're fired. <br>
    
    Winston : If only it were that simple, sire.
    
    Preston : Hogwash! This cat is mocking us at every turn. <br> <br>
    
    Winston : Preston, calm yourself. He's only doing what's best for us. <br>
    
    Preston : How much longer should we sustain this charade? <br>
    
    [Garfield peeks into the door]  <br>
    
    Preston : I can't believe this cat is so stupid as to think he is actually erotic. <br>
    
    Winston : Well, he does. And house cat or not, we need him. <br>
    
    Garfield : Wha - ? House cat? <br>
    
    Winston : Just have a little patience. <br>
    
    Preston : Patience? Fine. Admit it, Winston. This buffoon couldn't groom the paws of a real king. <br>
    
    Garfield : Buffoon? <br>
    
    Garfield : And there's the time I got hit by that car, <br>
    
    [scratches a line on the wall]  <br>
    
    Garfield : and the time I ate that six-day-old halibut. <br>
    
    [scratches another line on the wall]  <br>
    
    Garfield : That's only seven lives. I got two more. I'm gonna get out of this. <br>
    
    [a rock falls, creating a hole in the wall]  <br>
    
    Garfield : Bingo.
    
    I, Claudius : [pokes his head through the hole]  Winston and I have come to your rescue. <br>
    
    Garfield : Took you long enough. What, did you finally hear my stomach growl? <br>
    
    I, Claudius : [enters the dungeon]  No, but we heard your tiresome monologue. Bad halibut indeed. <br>
    
    [a rock moves, revealing an escape path from the dungeon]  <br>
    
    Winston : Let's get you out of here, your royal highness. <br>
    
    Garfield : Winster.
    
    Winston : The solicitors are here. We have to move quickly. <br>
    
    Garfield : Huh.
    
    Winston : Then we lunge in, your royal highness. <br>
    
    Garfield : Yeah, you can drop that shtik, drool boy. I heard you and the bird. How about the "house cat" part? I love that. <br>
    
    Winston : Oh, all right, all right, so we weren't exactly honest. We had to do it. What would you have done? <br>
    
    Garfield : Save your breath, chubby cheeks. I shall abdicate my throne and return to my TV chair. <br>
    
    Winston : You're our only hope. <br>
    
    Garfield : The only hope of the hopeless.</p>
